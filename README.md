# Arduino_Elevator
Concept Elevator control using Arduino Mega 2560
This program is an Arduino program to control 3 Floor elevator . In this project i used Arduino Mega 2560 .
I also used push buttons as a sensor so that if the elvator is close to certain stoping floor it will deaccelerate (using PWM) . 
NOTE : There is also a program that you can find on the internet by Khelil Issam , which helped me to write this program .
